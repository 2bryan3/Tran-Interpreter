Tran Language Interpreter

A simple interpreter for the Tran programming language, built using Java.

Overview:

This project is an interpreter for Tran, a custom programming language inspired by Java, C#, and Python. The interpreter consists of:

A Lexer that tokenizes the input source code.
A Parser that converts tokens into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST).
An Interpreter that executes the AST, evaluating expressions and statements.

Features:

Supports basic arithmetic and boolean expressions
Implements variables and assignment statements
Includes control structures like if-else and loop
Uses a custom syntax inspired by Java, C#, and Python

How It Works:

Lexical Analysis: The Lexer breaks source code into tokens.
Parsing: The Parser constructs an AST from tokens.
Execution: The Interpreter walks the AST and executes the code.
